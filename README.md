Calendar to keep track of rentals

The goal of this calendar is to have an overview of items rented out. This is a per item calendar. The items are rented out per day or per half day. There should be a connection with a website to show visitors if there are availabilities for a certain day. The back-office should have a clear view if a certain amount of rentals is possible for some date, or to see the first possibilities. This allows also to have the items rented out in a rotating manner to prevent wear and tear of one item instead of graduated wear. This comes also in handy to schedule maintenance.
